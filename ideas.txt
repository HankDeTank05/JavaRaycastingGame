for updating:
- multi-thread the raycasting operation. one thread per quadrant of the screen?

for drawing:
- use the command pattern: every pixel to draw is a command object and the draw method just loops through an array of
  command objects
- don't create a new color object for pixels of the same color. instead, create one color object for each unique color
  on the screen and associate it with an array of (x,y) coordinate pairs where that color should be drawn
- draw every pixel as a filled, colored rectangle, so that when you need to decrease the render resolution, you can
  increase the rectangle size to make it look pixelated
